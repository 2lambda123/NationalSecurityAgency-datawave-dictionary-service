### Getting Started

1. First, refer to [services/README](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/datawave-microservices-root/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) for launching the
   config, authorization, and audit services.

   * The authorization service should be launched with the `mock` profile to leverage
     test PKI materials and associated user configuration (see
     [authorization-mock.yml][auth-mock-yml]).

2. Launch this service as follows, with the `remoteauth` profile to enable client
   cert authentication.
    
   ```
   java -jar service/target/dictionary-service*-exec.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev,remoteauth
   ```

3. Ensure that the [testUser.p12][testUser] (password: *ChangeIt*) cert is imported into
   your browser, and then visit any of the following:

   * https://localhost:8843/dictionary/data/v1/
   * https://localhost:8843/dictionary/edge/v1/
   * Perform PUT and POST API operations with your preferred HTTP client, as desired
   
   See [sample_configuration/dictionary-dev.yml][dictionary-dev-yml] and configure as desired
